# 🚀 National Raffle Draw - Laravel API

This is a clound based API that is meant to be synced to by an offline application - the national raffle draw system. It was first a side project for a big coffee company in the Philippines, but since I just got paid so minimum, I decided to unbrand this and put it in my portfolio and public repositories so anyone can try it.
